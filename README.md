Project #2

In this project, our goal is to create a platform for users to be able to post and share their memories and reviews. Our idea for this app is to combine the ease of use and connection base of apps such as Instagram and the post-ability/ ideaology behind apps like Yelp or Google Maps. 

Users may have noticed that they cannot easily save any recommendations of restaurants, tourist spots, events, etc, and Google Maps/ Yelp reviews do not have a massive feature to save future adventure so this is where our project steps in to combine and offer a hybrid model for our fellow wanderlust nomads! 


## User Story
```
As a user,
I want to log into the mainpage,
So then I can access my posts and saved City and State. 

When I log in, 
Then I will have access to post my information for my past adventure on the homepage. 

When I see the auto-fill boxes, 
Then I have the ability to fill in my 'Best Memories', 'Worst Memories', 'City', 'State', 'Best Restaurants'.

When I add a City and State into the search field, 
Then I will be able to see the pin drop on a map. 

When I complete a post, 
Then it will save on my homepage. 

When I am finished with my session,
Then I am able to log out. 
```

## Tech Used

Here are the tech we used to implement this project
```
Heroku
GitHub
bcrypt: "^5.0.0",
connect-session-sequelize: "^7.0.4",
dotenv: "^8.2.0",
express: "^4.17.1",
express-handlebars: "^5.2.0",
express-session: "^1.17.1",
handlebars: "^4.7.6",
mysql2: "^2.2.5",
sequelize: "^6.3.5"
nodemon: "^2.0.7"
```

## Breakdown of Tasks
```
Donna Goon: Completing the server, controller files, models, touchup on the main handlebar, repo deployment on Heroku and Github. 
Nick Page: Front End Handlebars, creations of Maps API with active search functions.
Toussaint Gilbert: CSS and Stylizing, touchup on handlebars, documentation research. 
```

## Challenges

We faced many challenges with this project.

*Issues with getting handlebars to be responsive with models
*Issues with completely logging out.
*We could not get some of the handlebars to deploy on the mainpage
*Deploying during presentations
*Cleaning up the CSS
*Stylizing the CSS pages

## For the Future

We would love to implement more user-forward adaptations. Some of the ideas we have for this app would be:

```
Allowing users to log in using Google credentials. 
Connection to other social media pages, such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc so users would be able to connect, pull and post direct from the application. 
Intergration of an interactive map that allows users to pin their "places-to-go" and "places-I've-been"
Create highlight reels to serve as a memory showcase, allow to share to other social media pages. 
```
